1.  Interpolation sets the midpoint to where the item is likely to occur, so when the item is located towards the boundaries of a uniformly distributed array, interpolation search will likely require less splits of the array than binary search to find the item, who will always set the midpoint in the middle. The performance of the search will likely be superior to that of binary search, especially as the item to find is closer to the boundaries of the array.
2.  Interpolation search estimates where the item is likely to occur assuming the data is uniformly distributed. If the data follows a different distribution, the sort will not be able to properly estimate an appropriate midpoint, nor figure out the correct range of which the desired item is in. This negatively affects the performance of the sort, approaching O(n) time complexity in its worst case of searching values sequentially like linear search.
3.  When the data follows a different distribution, the calculation of pos will be changed to reflect on the non uniform likelihood of each position in the array.
4.  Binary and interpolation search can not be used for unsorted data because they are interval searches. Only sequential searches like linear search can be used for unsorted data.
5.  Linear search outperforms both binary and interpolation search when the desired item is in the first element of the array. Its complexity will be O(1), which interval searches like binary and interpolation can not best because they will try to divide the array into subarrays, so their worst cases are when the desired element is either first or last in the array.
6.  Interpolation is an improvement of binary in which it estimates where the desired item is likely to be, so even in its worst case where the desired item is either first or last, the midpoint will be set close to the desired item within a range much smaller than what binary search would have made. However, there is no way to best the linear search in its lucky best case of the desired item being the first element.
